    desc: "We are working with a research firm which assists us in our due diligence process and writes research reports on projects launching on our platform for an unbiased view - and so you know there is real utility.<br/>We are fully legally incorporated as Syspad LLC in St Vincent and thus fully compliant.<br/>Compared to our competitors, our costs to participate in a launch is extremely low!<br/>We have several partnerships, with the Syscoin foundation, PegaSys and more soon to be announced.<br/>Our AntiRug system is a design that is unique to our launchpad: all funds raised are released as an agreed upon timeline or achievements are met. Should a project be unable to continue, we are capable of issuing a refund to you.<br/><br/>We are working with a research firm to provide investors with professional research on projects launched on our platform, being fully legally incorporated, and having extremely low costs to participate in launches! Further, we plan to launch a customer protection mechanism where funds are released over time/as achievements are met. This prevents rug pulls and allows customer refunds should projects not succeed.",

    title: "Why are we better?", 
    desc: "We earn our revenue through revenue (commission in Stablecoins) rather than selling tokens. This eliminates a lot of the sell pressure that is typical for new projects.<br/>Our partnerships allow us to help you in a variety of ways, not just in terms of building a community, legal or marketing assistance. Our partnerships can help you reach dedicated investors, get listed on a DEX and increase your success through our AntiRug system. Our core team has extensive experience, having worked on similar DeFi projects, Bitcoin mining and in (TradFi) Investment Banking.",

    desc: "For those wishing to participate in a launch, you need to acquire some $Syspad. How much you purchase depends on your desired tier (ie how much USDC you wish to allocate). You then stake your Syspad and can then participate in a launch. Your Syspad will be locked to prevent manipulation close to project launches.",
